# Tracing Implementation Plan

## 1. Overview
The OpenAI Agent SDK provides built-in tracing capabilities that allow us to monitor and debug agent behavior. Tracing captures comprehensive records of events during agent runs, including LLM generations, tool calls, handoffs, and guardrails.

## 2. Benefits of Tracing
- **Debugging**: Identify issues in agent behavior and execution
- **Visualization**: See the flow of agent interactions
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track response times and token usage
- **Audit Trail**: Keep records of agent actions and decisions

## 3. Implementation Steps

### 3.1 Create Tracing Infrastructure
- Create a dedicated module for tracing functionality
- Implement trace context managers
- Set up trace processors
- Configure trace logging levels

### 3.2 Add Basic Tracing to Agent Operations
- Wrap agent initialization with tracing
- Add trace spans to agent runs
- Implement LLM generation tracing
- Add tracing for tool calls

### 3.3 Advanced Tracing Features
- Implement custom trace events
- Create workflow-level tracing
- Add metadata to traces
- Implement trace visualization

### 3.4 Testing Tracing Functionality
- Create unit tests for trace creation
- Create integration tests for trace capture
- Test trace visualization

### 3.5 Documentation
- Document tracing API
- Create usage examples
- Add configuration options documentation

## 4. Development Schedule
1. Basic tracing infrastructure (Day 1)
2. Agent operation tracing (Day 2)
3. Advanced tracing features (Day 3)
4. Testing and documentation (Day 4)

## 5. Code Quality Standards
- All code must pass linting (black, isort, mypy)
- Test coverage for tracing features should be >90%
- Documentation must be complete and clear
- Code must follow the project's style guidelines
